# Basics

For me, I struggled with R at the beginning trying to remember which package to install, and how to get started utilizing it. There are programs available to assist like Datacamp, but even with them, it is not alway easy to know what is needed or how the code is supposed to work. There are certain codes that I struggled getting to know because it needed another section of the code that I was not aware of. 
Because of my struggles with the program, I did some research to find the weaknesses of R studio and using R programming, and came across that fact that there is a steep learning curve for this language meaning that this is not just an issue with my learning, but is more common with the program. 

My goal for this package known as "Basics" is to give the basic fundamentals readily available in one package as opposed to having to install multiple different common packages that you may or may not know are needed for starting R coding and used most frequently. These are ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and tidyverse. This package also will give a brief understanding of each package at the beginning with what they are used for.
The next stage of this package is to give examples of the codes and how they should look. This will be using mtcars for the example dataset.


As I was working on this project, I read an article where you are not meant to add library to your package, which was the main process for this assignment. I still wanted to create a package that helped get a better understanding of these three main packages.
